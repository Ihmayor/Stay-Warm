What can we do? 

1) Remove Float and Follow Mechanic. This should be the other version of this game where the player must collect
as many of these from puzzles as they can to complete a piece of a heart. 

Essentially WarmHeart(+0.1) where Heart Meter is 0 and goal is 1

================================= LATEST===========================================
Most important:
- FINISH CHAR RESPAWN NOW!!!< ===== FIX RESPAWNING FADE IN MENU ARRRRRRRRRGH
- FINISH LEVEL LOADING ONCE RESPAWN POINT CODE IS COMPLETE
- REFACTOR INHERTANCE FOR DROP SOURCE YET

2) PLEASE OPTIMIZE INSTEAD OF INSTATIATING AND DESTROYING KEEP TRACK OF AN OBJECT POOL DEACTIVATE AND MOVE THE POSITION
    Update: Finished Wind Resources Managing 
	Todo PlatformerManager.cs: 200 steps as resource pool. 30 spikes. If this lags run time then gradual population can be used. 
              

3) Finish Cooling Element => Inherit. Create Wind Element and Drop Element both to inherit from the cooling element
