- FINISH CHAR RESPAWN NOW!!!< ===== FIX RESPAWNING FADE IN MENU

- Charge_01 mimic. For when we've reached warming element.
- Glowing orb follow when heart gained as a replacement. Mimic as well.

================================= LATEST===========================================
Most important:

- FINISH STAGE 4 AND STAGE 5 
	Stage 4: 3 drop sources + Staircases 
        Stage 5: Play more with stair cases
      => Publish and see if you can get some testers at this point

- Refurbish Heat Points 
      - On levels > 8 make them only work once.

- FINISH LEVEL LOADING ONCE RESPAWN POINT CODE IS COMPLETE

- REFACTOR INHERTANCE FOR DROP SOURCE YET

2) PLEASE OPTIMIZE INSTEAD OF INSTATIATING AND DESTROYING KEEP TRACK OF AN OBJECT POOL DEACTIVATE AND MOVE THE POSITION
    Update: Finished Wind Resources Managing 
	Todo PlatformerManager.cs: 200 steps as resource pool. 30 spikes. If this lags run time then gradual population can be used. 
              

3) Finish Cooling Element => Inherit. Create Wind Element and Drop Element both to inherit from the cooling element

Misc Notes
=========================================
Other version of this game will be where the player must collect as many of these pieces of paper which will use the follow & float code.
They will get them from puzzles so they can complete a piece of a heart. 

Essentially WarmHeart(+0.1) where Heart Meter is 0 and goal is 1
