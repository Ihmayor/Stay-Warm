What can we do? 

1) Remove Float and Follow Mechanic. This should be the other version of this game where the player must collect
as many of these from puzzles as they can to complete a piece of a heart. 

Essentially WarmHeart(+0.1) where Heart Meter is 0 and goal is 1

 

2) PLEASE OPTIMIZE INSTEAD OF INSTATIATING AND DESTROYING KEEP TRACK OF AN OBJECT POOL DEACTIVATE AND MOVE THE POSITION
